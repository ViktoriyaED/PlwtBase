## Project Features

####
* To ensure an organized and efficient approach to the testing process, the project has been structured using the Page Object Model (POM).
  This design pattern allows for easy maintenance and scalability of the test framework, ensuring that any future changes or additions can be easily integrated into the existing structure.
####
* In order to provide comprehensive and insightful reports on the test results, the project utilizes Allure Report.
####
* Go to the resources package and copy the file access.properties.TEMPLATE and browser.properties.TEMPLATE.
  Paste it into the resources package and rename the new file to access.properties and browser.properties.
####
* After installation, a command can be used in the terminal to <b>run the tests</b> locally: `mvn clean test`
####
* Generate local <b>allure report</b>: `mvn allure:serve`
####
* Check the last allure report on CI: [Allure Report]()
